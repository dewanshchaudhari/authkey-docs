### What is the purpose of the Authkey as a Service platform?

The platform provides a secure and convenient way for businesses to
implement user authentication through WhatsApp one-time passwords
(OTPs). It also helps businesses verify whether the number exists on
whatsapp or not

### How does the platform work for user authentication?

Businesses integrate our API into their applications or systems. When
a user needs to be verified, a one-time password (OTP) is generated
and sent to the user&#39;s WhatsApp number. The user enters the
received OTP for authentication.

### How can businesses integrate WhatsApp OTP?

We provide comprehensive documentation and API guides to facilitate
easy integration. Developers can follow the step-by-step instructions
to incorporate WhatsApp OTP authentication seamlessly in under 2 mins.

### What is the monthly Subscription charges?

You pay for what you use. There are no subscription charges

### Do I need to apply for facebook API?

No. Everything is handled by us. We use our own systems to send out
the OTPs

### How to not get Banned?

    WhatsApp knows that it&#39;s uncommon for someone to send so many messages
    or bulk messages to people they&#39;ve never talked to each other before so
    it is considered spam/marketing junk pretty fast. There are some tips before
    sending a message to WhatsApp

#### Dos and Don'ts

    1. Important: Do NOT send messages which get you a report. As long as you
    don&#39;t get reports from users who you sent a message, your account will
    be mostly fine.


    2. Having real content, a survey that the person agreed with is different
    than a marketing message on a Saturday night.


    3. Send messages written in different ways, you could make a script that
    places spacebars randomly on your string AND includes the person&#39;s
    (first) name


    4. Never use fixed times, always go for sending the first message, wait a
    random time between 30 ~ and 60 seconds and then send the second message

    5. Always try to group contacts by their area code, WhatsApp expects a
    regular person to talk mostly with contacts that are within the same area of
    your phone number.

    6. Have a profile picture, this is not related to WhatsApp Bots CatcherÂ® but
    sending a new message for someone not having a picture/name/status will
    elevate your chances of being manually tagged as spam.

    7. Send &#39;seen&#39; confirmation to messages or disable it on WhatsApp

    8. Avoid sending links that were previously marked as spam on WhatsApp or
    non-HTTPS. A URL shortener is a good idea

    9. IMPORTANT: It&#39;s really bad if you send messages 24/7 without giving
    it some time to wait. Random delays between messages are not enough, send a
    reasonable amount of messages keeping in mind your conversion rate, For
    example: for one hour send a maximum of 4 messages per contact that have
    replied to your message, and stop sending messages for one hour, then start
    again. Again, don&#39;t send messages without stopping for a while between
    every &#39;package&#39;

    10. Send only one short message when starting a conversation, one should not
    send long texts or multiple messages without the user consenting

11. Avoid prefixes for messages

#### Have in mind:

1. For every one you send a message that doesn&#39;t have your number on their
   contact list asked if it&#39;s spam, being tagged as spam a few times (5 - 10)
   will get you banned

2. WhatsApp records every movement you do, you can even check the logs when
   sending simple support email, it contains all kinds of information, this said:
   act as human as possible

3. Try to engage in conversations, as long as you send a message and the
   person doesn&#39;t automatically block you it&#39;ll be quite okay. People
   constantly talking to you and adding you to their contact list will make your
   number stronger against a ban

4. Think about that like a points system, you start with zero points (negative
   if your device was previously blacklisted), if you reach below zero you are
   out, if you engage in conversations you get a point, if you are tagged as spam
   you lose some points, if you are blocked you may lose more points

5. Finally, If your content is spam, it doesn&#39;t matter if you are using a
   broadcast list, group, or direct contact, you will still be banned

As API providers we say all that&#39;s left to do right now is agree with
WhatsApp&#39;s policy, not send spam messages, and always wait for the other
person to contact you first. You could make it by sending an SMS to the person
with a link to start a chat on WhatsApp with you.
